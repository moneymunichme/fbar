# FBAR Max Balances Generator

The Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) is form that must be filed by all US citizens who hold foreign accounts holding at least $10,000. When filing this report, one must supply the maximum balance for each foreign account for a given year. This Python script utilizes the YNAB API to generate the maximum balance for each account for a user for a given calendar year. 

## Dependencies

* prettytable
* pyyaml
* ynab==0.0.3

## Usage

1. Generate a [YNAB Personal Access Token](https://api.youneedabudget.com/#personal-access-tokens).
2. Edit [config.yml](config.yml) to add your token as well as the relevant year and [currency conversion rate](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/yearly-average-currency-exchange-rates).
3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run main script:
```
python main.py
```
A report, like the one below, will be generated.
